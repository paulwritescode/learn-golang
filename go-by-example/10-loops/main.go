	/**
	. The majority of times we will be looping over stuff
	. we will work with : key, value and range
	. key : works for maps that is a key value pair type {"key":value} NB: this can be ommited
	. value : value corresponding to the key
	. range : points to the item that we want to loop over, range will
	  refer to the full content in it from the first to last. That will be the range

	. we do not have while loop in go
	. continue: skip this and go on with what you were doing
	. break: stop and get out, go to the last step
	. labels : works like break
