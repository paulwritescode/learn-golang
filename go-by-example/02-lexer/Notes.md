We do not use semicolons (;) at the end of every line since the lexer will automatically include it for us when we save the file for compilation.
Lexer ensures that we follow the rules of the language.

> const pie = 3.14;
>> This is the same as
>> const pie = 3.14

Capital letter means that it is accessible publicly. Small case means it is accessible localy (with regards to the file and project)
